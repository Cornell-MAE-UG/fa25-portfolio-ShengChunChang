## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I am Angus (Sheng Chun) Chang, a Cornell University mechanical engineering student who loves taking ideas from a rough sketch all the way to working hardware. My interests sit at the intersection of CAD design, rapid prototyping, and real world testing, whether I am optimizing drone frames on the Cornell Autonomous Drone Project Team or fabricating lightweight wings for a bat inspired robot in the Bio Inspired Fluid Lab. I have also led research that resulted in patents on an artificial leaf that generates both electricity and oxygen, as well as novel material structures, and my work has been recognized by competitions such as Regeneron Science Talent Search and the International Science and Engineering Fair. On this portfolio, you will see the same mindset behind all of my projects: careful problem framing, thoughtful design, and a willingness to iterate in the lab until the hardware matches the vision.
