This project is a custom-designed 5-inch freestyle FPV drone frame built in Autodesk Fusion 360, focused on durability, modularity, and real-world crash protection. The frame features a widened base plate that extends coverage for the flight controller and ESC to help absorb impacts, a reinforced camera mount with a deeper, enclosed housing that protects the lens without blocking the field of view, and a modular arm layout that allows quick arm replacement in the field while maintaining rigidity. Its geometry is tuned specifically for freestyle flying, minimizing frame flex while balancing agility and strength, and the design is prepared for CNC carbon-fiber manufacturing or 3D-printed prototyping, with Betaflight-compatible stack spacing and cable clearance. Provided files include the original Fusion 360 source (drone_frame_v1.f3z), exportable .step and .stl models for fabrication, and render folders for previews and exploded views. Planned next steps are to print a PLA/ABS prototype for dimensional validation, finalize a carbon-fiber CNC version, perform real-world testing with PID tuning for crash performance, and optionally add a GoPro mount bracket and antenna guard.
