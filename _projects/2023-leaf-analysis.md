This project explores how to build an “artificial leaf” that can generate both oxygen and electricity using chlorella microalgae instead of traditional plant leaves. Chlorella cells are encapsulated in an optimized sodium alginate–barium chloride hydrogel that retains water, allows air exchange, and is protected with a natural boric-acid preservative. In testing, the artificial leaf produced about 11 mg/L of dissolved oxygen within 6–12 hours and generated up to 1.3 V using copper–magnesium electrodes, similar to the voltage of an AA battery. These results demonstrate a low-cost, eco-friendly concept for simultaneously improving air quality and powering simple devices.
